# General tips for mentors

Mentor is an expert and can adjust module to own preferences. We prepared some basic rules that help mentoring:

1. Prepare the scope and materials for the module before starting, including the number of hours with the mentor, no more than X (_not specified yet_) hours total.
2. Have the module programme reviewed by program coordinators before starting.
3. Limit the amount of material, be realistic about what your trainee can absorb.
4. Your time is precious, it’s ok to reuse materials you can find on the Internet.
5. Avoid long lectures, recommending great resources instead (youtube, blogs).
6. Avoid long tutoring sessions, hand out homework, conducting Q&A and problem-solving sessions instead.
7. Use good online tutorials and courses if available for the subject, meeting periodically to help make progress.
8. Share your personal experience and perspective, it’s ok to be opinionated.
9. Recommend resources for further self-development (e.g. books).
10. Individual work or small study groups (up to 3 people).

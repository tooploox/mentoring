# Tooploox Mentoring Program
This repository contains resources for cross-skilling engineering Plooxies with help from experienced mentors or by self-development.

> Currently we are working on the program and testing it with small group of people.

## Purposes of program
* Share knowledge in Tooploox and learn from the best engineers
  * This is the space for our most experienced engineers to share their knowledge internally, building up skills of every Tooploox engineer.
* _Fullstacify_: Cross-train our engineers, helping them gain skills in their non-core technologies to become more self-sufficient in projects requiring some full-stack skills. 
  * An example is an ML engineer making some changes to an existing back-end or ever writing their own simple REST API wrapper for an ML model.

## How it works

The course, currently focusing on back-end development in Python, is divided up into modules, making it easy to digest it in bite-sized chunks, each module standing on its own, letting you mix and match, choosing the modules _you_ think will benefit you the most.

The Backend Python modules list is on [this page](python_backend/MODULE_LIST.md).

### Learn and get help from mentors

Every module has a mentor, responsible for shaping the module, preparing the exercises, and guiding you through the learning process. Mentor is an expert
in his module. We take care to ensure each module is of high quality, built by mentors who are experts in the given area, every module carefully reviewed before it gets published.

We are all busy. Mentors aren't lecturers, giving long boring presentations. Instead, they focus on finding the best resources, and on supporting you throughout the learning process, reviewing your solutions to exercises and answering your questions, letting you work at your own pace.

The project coordinators are responsible for connecting learners and mentors, help selecting modules and so on. New mentors are selected from the best Tooploox engineers by the project coordinators and current mentors.

### Self-development & share resources

This repository is also a place for link sharing for every module (see module list). This is open
for every contribution.

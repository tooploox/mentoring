# Tooploox Mentoring Program
This repository contains resources designed to upskilling engineering Plooxies with help from experienced mentors or by self-development.

> Currently we are working on the program and testing it with small group of people.

## Purposes of program
* Share knowledge in Tooploox and learn from the best engineers
  * Tooploox is full of well-experienced, the best engineers. We want to create space to
    share their knowledge with every Plooxie. This will build yet stronger skills set in Tooploox, in every Plooxie Engineer.
* _Fullstacify_: Help Plooxies gaining useful skills from their not-main domain/technology. 
  * This is not designed to reskilling anyone. We want help Plooxies to being able
    do more than their main technology. Most projects requires some technology as support,
    e.g. AI project can need smaller changes to existing backend. We try to address this problem.
* (future) Develop experience in main technology.
  * We use our technology but we can feel less-experience in some topics. This program is
    also designed to find people and resources who can help with specified topics, like
    docerizing, integration testing or so.

## How it works

We designed a track (currently only backend with Python) parted into modules. Every module
is focused on specific skill and tools, intended to be not so long. The track shouldn't be
used as a hardcoded, only-true way and order. Modules should be selected depending on
current needs, willingness and knowledge.

The Backend Python modules list is [todo].

### Learn and get help from mentor

Every module has or will have a mentor who prepare or find
exercises, resources and maybe preferred way of learning or so. Mentor is an expert
in their module. Anyway, any prepared module pack is reviewed and accepted to get designed
skills.

Mentor isn't a _teacher_. They help, find best resources, review solutions and share their
knowledge. There is no long-time lectures or so, the main work learners do at their own.

The project coordinators are responsible for connect learners and mentors, help select modules or so. Mentors are selected from the best Tooploox Engineers by project coordinators or current mentors.

### Self-development & share resources

In this repository is also a place for link sharing for every module [todo]. This is open
for every contribution. [TBD]

## Python track

### Flask track

You will find flask tutorials here.
Tutorials will show you how to:

Flask 101
- [x] create a flask app
- [x] create API endpoints

Flask 102
- [x] access query parameters passed in the url
- [x] access path parameters passed in the url

Flask 10x/20x

- [ ] learn on POST/GET methods
- [ ] upload a file to server
- [ ] download a file from server
- [ ] use page templates
- [ ] use sessions
- [ ] create login page
- [ ] restrict access to API to certain users
- [ ] test your flask app
- [ ] call an external API in your flask app

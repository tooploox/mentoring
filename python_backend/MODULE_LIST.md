# Module list for Backend with Python

Following list contains topics useful for Backend Python Engineers in Tooploox, divided into modules.
It's neither final nor unchangeable list, but we think it covers most important parts. Some modules are more,
some less specified - the final shape is created by mentor.

In every module there is a section for links to external resources. You can use it for self-development, but also
update, send new links and remove no longer useful ones. It's a place for sharing interesting materials associated
with module's topic. Feel free to contribute!

> When you are looking into new topics, it's always better to use already recommended materials.
> So, when you find something that could be useful for others as well, just send a PR with it!

Modules aren't ordered - numbers are only to help identifying them.
